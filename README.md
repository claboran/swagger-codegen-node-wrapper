<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project has a long history. Coinfolium was launched as a freely accessible Crypto Portfolio Tracker and was 
revised in 2019. The focus was on a usage without registration and completely anonymous. 
The sources were not under any open source license at that time. The source for the market data at this time was the
[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API.

After the withdrawal of some project participants, the idea for a reorientation was born. The backend is to be newly
developed under an open source license. Still committed to the idea of free use.

A new provider for market data has been taken into account: [Alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/api/).
Although no historical data is going to be provided, the free nature of the API seems to make it best suited.

Following goals are going to be addressed:
* Provide a stable platform for import and storage of market data
* Provide a REST API for the various clients (development will start soon based on the existing codebase, 
still open if this will be under Open Source too)
* Provide Authentication, Authorization, Registration and user basic data management in a safe manner 


### Built With
